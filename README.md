# Titanic-classification
Titanic classification predicts survival based on passenger data. Using machine learning algorithms, it analyzes features like age, gender, and class in a labeled dataset. The goal is to create a model that accurately classifies new data, reflecting the likelihood of survival in a Titanic-like scenario.

Introduction
The Titanic survival prediction project aims to classify whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features like age, sex, passenger class, and more. This project is a classic example of binary classification in the field of machine learning.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Titanic competition. It contains the following files:

train.csv: The training dataset containing the features and survival status of passengers.
Features
The dataset contains the following features:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Fare paid by the passenger
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training. This includes:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Normalizing numerical features
Splitting the data into training and validation sets
Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Key steps include:

Visualizing the distribution of features
Analyzing the correlation between features and survival
Identifying any potential outliers
Model Building
Various machine learning models are used to predict survival, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are performed to optimize the models.
Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

-Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score Confusion matrices and other visualizations are used to interpret the results.
